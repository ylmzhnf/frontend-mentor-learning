## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While using semantic HTML, I tried to stay faithful to the design and created a clear class structure. I used Flexbox for the mobile layout and a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for the desktop layout. Adjusting the layout and spacing with margins and padding repeatedly was the most challenging part for me.

Technical Details:

- Used Flexbox for mobile and CSS Grid for desktop to create a responsive and consistent layout.

- Implemented CSS custom properties for colors, fonts, and spacing (e.g., --green-500: hsl(171, 66%, 44%);).

- Followed a mobile-first approach, designing for mobile first and adding desktop adjustments with media queries.

- Managed hover, focus, and active states in CSS to improve user interaction.

- Optimized backgrounds and images for responsive display (background-size: contain;).

- Ensured consistent component spacing and typography across different screen sizes.
