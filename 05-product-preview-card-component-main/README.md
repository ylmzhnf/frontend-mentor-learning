## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main focus and learning points in this project were combining performance, accessibility, and modern CSS layout techniques:

1. Responsive Images with <picture>: I learned the importance of using the <picture> element with <source media> to serve optimized images at the right breakpoints, significantly improving mobile performance.

2. Desktop Layout: I successfully implemented Flexbox to divide the card into two equal columns (1:1 ratio) for the image and content, and used justify-content: space-around; to vertically center the content block.

3. BEM-like Class Consistency: I maintained clear, BEM-like naming conventions (e.g., product-card__image, product-price__current) throughout the project to ensure clean, readable, and scalable CSS.

### Continued development

- Accessibility (A11y): I will continue to focus on implementing detailed keyboard focus (:focus states) testing and better general ARIA attributes for interactive elements.

- Performance: I aim to further improve page load speed by eliminating unnecessary resource loading (like the unused Outfit and Young Serif fonts in this project) and optimizing CSS delivery.
